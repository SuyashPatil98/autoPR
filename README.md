# Code Review Automation for Pull Requests

## Overview
This project aims to automate the process of reviewing pull requests (PRs) in a software repository to identify potential issues (e.g., bugs, security vulnerabilities, code smells) and reduce the workload on human reviewers. The system uses machine learning to classify PRs and provide actionable suggestions, improving code quality and developer productivity.

---

## Problem Definition and Business Understanding
### Objective
Automate the review of pull requests to identify critical issues and reduce manual effort.

### Success Metrics
- Reduce PR review time by 30%.
- Achieve 90% precision in identifying critical issues.
- Improve code quality by catching 20% more issues before merging.

### Stakeholders
- Software developers
- Code reviewers
- Engineering managers

---

## Data Collection and Preparation
### Data Sources
- Historical pull request data from GitHub or GitLab.
- Code diffs, comments, and review outcomes.
- Static analysis tool outputs (e.g., SonarQube, ESLint).

### Data Quality
- Clean and preprocess code diff text (e.g., remove whitespace, normalize syntax).
- Handle imbalanced data (e.g., few critical issues vs. many non-critical ones).

### Feature Engineering
- Extract features from code diffs (e.g., added lines, removed lines, file types).
- Use embeddings for code (e.g., Code2Vec, CodeBERT) to represent code changes.
- Include metadata features (e.g., PR size, author experience, time of day).

### Data Splits
- Training: 70%
- Validation: 15%
- Test: 15%

## Model Development
### Model Selection
- Binary or multi-class classification (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or fine-tuned CodeBERT).

### Experimentation
- Track experiments using MLflow or Weights & Biases.
- Experiment with different feature sets and model architectures.

### Evaluation
- Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.
- Compare against a baseline model (e.g., random guessing or rule-based heuristics).

### Final Model
- Fine-tuned CodeBERT for code review classification.

---

## Model Deployment
### Model Packaging
- Export the fine-tuned CodeBERT model using TensorFlow SavedModel or PyTorch.

### API Development
- Use FastAPI to create a REST API for real-time PR review suggestions.

### Containerization
- Package the API and model in a Docker container.

### Orchestration
- Deploy the container on Kubernetes for scalability.

### Cloud Platform
- Use Azure ML or AWS SageMaker for hosting and monitoring.

---

## Monitoring and Maintenance
### Performance Monitoring
- Track classification accuracy and API latency using Prometheus and Grafana.

### Data Drift Detection
- Monitor changes in code diff patterns using Evidently AI.

### Model Retraining
- Set up a pipeline to retrain the model monthly using new PR data.

### Logging and Alerts
- Use the ELK Stack for logging and alerting.

---

## Scalability and Reliability
### Scalability
- Use Kubernetes to auto-scale the API based on traffic.

### Fault Tolerance
- Implement retries and fallback mechanisms in the API.

### Load Testing
- Use Locust to simulate high traffic and identify bottlenecks.

---

## Security and Compliance
### Data Security
- Encrypt code diff data in transit using TLS.

### Access Control
- Use OAuth2 or JWT to restrict API access to authorized users.

### Compliance
- Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).

---

## Documentation and Reproducibility
### Code Documentation
- Use Sphinx to generate documentation for the codebase.

### Pipeline Documentation
- Document the end-to-end workflow in a Confluence page.

### Reproducibility
- Use DVC to version control datasets and MLflow to track experiments.

---

## User Interface
### Dashboards
- Build a dashboard using Streamlit or Dash to visualize PR review trends and model performance.

### Feedback Mechanism
- Allow developers to flag incorrect suggestions for model improvement.

---

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
### Automated Testing
- Write unit tests for the API and model using pytest.

### CI/CD Pipelines
- Use GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

### Rollback Mechanism
- Use Kubernetes rollback features to revert to a previous version if needed.

---

## Cost Management
### Resource Optimization
- Use spot instances on AWS for training and deployment.

### Cost Monitoring
- Use AWS Cost Explorer to track and optimize costs.

---

## Team Collaboration
### Version Control
- Use Git for code collaboration.

### Project Management
- Use Jira to track tasks and progress.

### Knowledge Sharing
- Conduct weekly team meetings and maintain a knowledge base in Confluence.

---

## Post-Deployment Evaluation
### A/B Testing
- Compare the automated review system against manual reviews.

### User Feedback
- Collect feedback from developers to improve the system.

### Impact Analysis
- Measure the reduction in PR review time and improvement in code quality over 6 months.
